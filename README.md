## Assignment 2

Mostly PrintWriter, BufferedWriter and Document Object Model (DOM) concepts of java are used to complete this project. Three text files with .xml extensions are downloaded from [PubMed Baseline Repository](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/updatefiles/).Those text files are merged together using BufferedWriter and copied to another new file .xml file using PrintWriter.

After that to abstract the data from the new file DOM is used. The final output is Title and year of an article which abstract text contains a keyword **cancer**

I am sure there are many things that can be improved here. Please let me know if you have any feedback.

Thank you.
