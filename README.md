## Assignment 2

Mostly PrintWriter, BufferedWriter and Document Object Model (DOM) concepts of java are used to complete this project. Three text files with .xml extensions are downloaded from [PubMed Baseline Repository](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/updatefiles/).Those text files are merged together using BufferedWriter and copied to another new file .xml file using PrintWriter.

After that to extract the data from the new file DOM is used. The program takes user input and searches in the merged .xml file. If user input matches the word in the merged file then it will display the Title of the article and the year. 

After that it stores the user entered keyword and time stamp in an ArrayList and shows that to the user.


Thank you.
